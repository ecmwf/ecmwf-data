### Description
`ecmwf-data` is a package to provide easy ways to handle ECMWF data, starting with GRIB
data. It can be used to load one or more GRIB files into a `Fieldset`, which is a container of fields. It provides quick ways to inspect the data, along with powerful data filtering capabilities and numerical operations between Fieldsets and numbers, as well as Fieldsets and other Fieldsets. See the [example notebook](notebooks/) to see how it works.
